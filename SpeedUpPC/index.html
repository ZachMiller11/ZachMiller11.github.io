<p>Method to Activate Developer Processing Mode (DPM) on your PC<br>
This mode is a newly discovered artifact within the Windows system. It has only been used by developers and has the potential to speed your computer
<br>up to at least twice its current speed.
<br>Yeah, I know this seems too good to be true. That's what I thought until I attempted it.
<br>
<br>1. Press the windows key and R at the same time to launch the Run prompt.
<br>2. Type "eventvwr" and press enter. The Event Viewer window will open.
<br>3. Expand "Windows Logs" and then click "Application". Eventually, a list of Information, Warnings and Errors will show up.
<br>4. Find the first one marked "Error," right click it, and save it. The name you give it needs to be the Event ID it has.
<br>5. Locate it on your PC and make sure you have file extensions visible. Rename the file extension from .evtx to .vbs. DO NOT OPEN IT.
<br>6. Open Task Manager and click File and then Run New Task. Click Browse and locate the file we just created. Click Open and then OK. An "Error Message" should pop up.
<br>7. Once this error is open, hold the windows key for around five seconds. Then, move your mouse directly above the X button on the error and hit the L key.
